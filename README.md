## Python Styling Guide
My chosen styling guide is PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code(van Rossum, Warsaw and Coghlan, 2001). My terminal application will adhere to PEP 8, a commonly used styling guide within Python (GeeksforGeeks, 2020). I have an installed autopep8 package to have my code adhere to PEP 8 Styling guide standards consistently throughout my application.
