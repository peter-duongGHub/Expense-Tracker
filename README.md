## Help Documentation - Steps, Dependencies, System/Hardware Requirements, Command Line Arguments for application
This help documentation will include a comprehensive guide on how to run Peter's Expense Tracker on Windows, Linux and Mac.

### Step 1 - Python Installation
Users must first download Python on their operating system. It is recommended to download Python version 3.6 or greater. The download for Linux, Windows and Mac may be found here. 
[Python-Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Step 4 - Extract Zip File
Users must download Peter's Expense Tracker Terminal Application zip file and have the file extracted to use the terminal application.



Required packages that have been installed for my python terminal application will be located in a file named requirements.txt. This will include:
- rich
- pyinstaller
- pytest

## Expense Tracker
- To use the terminal application users must change directory to src directory. Within Ubuntu for Windows or for linux, typing the below snippet will help direct users to the correct directory for execution of the application.     
```cd src``` 

- To automate the process, an executable .sh file has been created to help users install required dependencies, software automate the terminal application. The executable script is run by typing the below inside a terminal application. 
```./expense_tracker_script.sh```

### Main Menu Terminal
![T1A3-Main-Menu](./docs/T1A3_Main_Menu.PNG)  
When starting up the Terminal Application users will see a main menu screen introducing users to the terminal application and asking users to select between two options (1 - 2).
1. Start Expense Tracker
2. Exit Program

### User Budget Input
Selecting Option "1. Start Expense Tracker" will:
1. Prompt users for a budget input ![User-Budget](./docs/T1A3_Main_Menu_Budget.PNG)

take users to a second sub menu page where they will be prompted with a list of 




### Users may add expenses
- Users may input expenses including expense name, amount, date, location & category. These expenses will be saved to a CSV file
### How Users will add expenses
Users will first be prompted at the main menu to select 1 of 3 options. 
- Execute Peter's Expense tracking application
Selecting 1. to execute the application program will send users to a sub menu where users will be prompted to choose from options 1 to 5. 
1. Add & Save Expenses to a CSV File

After selecting Option 1 within the sub menu, users will be made to enter a while loop with condition "True". 


2. View Expenses
3. Remove a Specific Expense from a CSV File
4. Total Expenses, Total based on Category and Subtraction of Expenses from User Input Budget
5. Return to Main Menu
  

- View Instructions on how to operate Peter's Expense tracking application
- Exit the Program


be included in a while loop condition after selecting option  
"1. Add & Save expense to CSV file"

## Python Styling Guide
My chosen styling guide is PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code(van Rossum, Warsaw and Coghlan, 2001). My terminal application will adhere to PEP 8, a commonly used styling guide within Python (GeeksforGeeks, 2020). I have an installed autopep8 package to have my code adhere to PEP 8 Styling guide standards consistently throughout my application.
